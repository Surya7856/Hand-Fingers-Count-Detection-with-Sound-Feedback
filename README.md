# Hand-Fingers-Count-Detection-with-Sound-Feedback
🎶 Hand Fingers Count Detection with Sound Feedback 🎶
This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect the number of fingers shown by a hand in real-time and plays a unique sound for each detected finger count. It combines the power of OpenCV, YOLO, and audio libraries to create an interactive and fun experience for gesture-based sound control.
🛠️ Features:

    Real-time hand tracking and finger count detection using MediaPipe Hands.
    Plays different sounds for each finger count (0-5 or more).
    Simple and intuitive interface for real-time feedback.
    Can be extended for creative applications like music generation, educational tools, or interactive installations.

🧰 Technologies Used:

    Python for development.
    OpenCV for video processing.
    YOLO model for hand landmark detection and gesture recognition.
    Pygame for audio playback.

🚀 How It Works:

    The camera captures the user's hand.
    The system detects hand landmarks using openCV.
    Finger count is determined based on the positions of the landmarks.
    A unique sound is played corresponding to the detected finger count.

🖥️ Setup Instructions:

    Clone the repository.
    Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the script and enjoy!

🌟 Use Cases:

    Interactive soundboards.
    Teaching tools for kids to learn counting.
