# 🎶 Hand Fingers Count Detection with Sound Feedback 🎶
This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect the number of fingers shown by a hand in real-time and plays a unique sound for each detected finger count. It combines the power of OpenCV, YOLO, and audio libraries to create an interactive and fun experience for gesture-based sound control.

## 🛠️ Features:

- Real-time hand tracking and finger count detection using MediaPipe Hands.
- Plays different sounds for each finger count (0-5 or more).
- Simple and intuitive interface for real-time feedback.
- Can be extended for creative applications like music generation, educational tools, or interactive installations.

## 🧰 Technologies Used:

- Python for development.
- OpenCV for video processing.
- YOLO model for hand landmark detection and gesture recognition.
- Pygame for audio playback.

## 🚀 How It Works:

- The camera captures the user's hand.
- The system detects hand landmarks using openCV.
- Finger count is determined based on the positions of the landmarks.
- A unique sound is played corresponding to the detected finger count.

## 🖥️ Setup Instructions:
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required dependencies using following command
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Go the file directory
- Run the script using following command and enjoy!
- `python myhand.py`

## 🌟 Use Cases:
- Teaching tools for kids to learn counting.

  
Happy coding! 😊
