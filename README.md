# Hand-Fingers-Count-Detection-with-Sound-Feedback
This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect the number of fingers shown by a hand in real-time and plays a unique sound for each detected finger count. It combines the power of OpenCV, YOLO, and audio libraries to create an interactive and fun experience for gesture-based sound control.
